						<h2>Thesis Research - Perception and Motion Planning Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
						<h5>Pattern Discovery and Machine Learning (PDML) Lab, University of Texas at Dallas</h5>
						<p>
							<p>
								As part of my on-going thesis research under the guidance of Prof. Feng Chen on Perception and Motion Planning components of Autonomous Driving Systems in the Pattern Discovery and Machine Learning (PDML) Laboratory 
								at UT Dallas, I am experimenting with Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, namely, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic algorithms (SAC) powered by agent’s camera POV image
								features and also Uncertainty-Aware Object Detection components. The Uncertainty-Aware Object Detection is particularly designed to 
								compute Out-of-Distribution (OOD) probabilities of the objects identified by the object detection component in order to augment the motion planning deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

								The deep reinforcement learning algorithms were trained on CARLA Autonomous Driving Simulator Engine. The simulator is wrapped as a custom OpenAI gym environment so that data streamed from the simulator engine can be 
								accessed in real time (with synchronization) when used for training with Deep RL algorithms with the objective to plan the motion path of the agent (vehicle).
